Visualization
=========================

This is a project that utilizes Vivagraph.js and the Blockchain.info API to map out bitcoin transactions in real time.

It merges existing features from [bits.coinlaunch.com](http://bits.coinlaunch.com) and [dailyblockchain.github.io](http://dailyblockchain.github.io), along with several original features to make a beautiful, useful mempool analyzer on the web.
